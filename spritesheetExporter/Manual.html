<h3>Spritesheet exporter: exports as spritesheets</h3>

<br>
<h3>Why use it</h3>
<p>
Most pixel art games use spritesheets for their animations, but manually exporting from the animation timeline is a pain, effectively destroys your animation if you do it on the same file, and with every new modification you need to start all over again.<br>
This plugin allows you to easily export the active animation as a spritesheet without modifying your current working document.
</p>

<br>
<h3>How to use it</h3>
<p>
<b>Tools > Scripts > Export As Spritesheet </b>will export the animation from the currently selected document's animation timeline.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p><b>export name</b>: if you type in "exportName", the name of the individual exported frames will be exportName_000.png, exportName_001.png, etc., and the spritesheet will be called exportName.png . If your name contains a comma, anything after the first comma will be ignored, and the file will still export as a png (for example, "exportName", "exportName.png", "exportName.pdf", "exportName.v12.final.finalfinal.xcf" will all export to the same name, see example just above).<br>
<b>export directory</b>: select the folder in which the spritesheet will be exported (the frames will be exported in a subfolder of the export directory called exportName_sprites if no <b>sprites export directory</b> is set)<br>
<b>change export directory</b>: Opens a file explorer to select the Export Directory<br>
<b>reset to current directory</b>: Resets the export directory to the directory containing the currently active .kra document<br>
<b>export direction</b>: How the frames are placed. For example, in a 3*2 grid, frame numbers are as follows:<br>
if horizontal:<br>
1, 2, 3<br>
4, 5, 6<br>
if vertical:<br>
1, 3, 5<br>
2, 4, 6<br>
<b>rows</b>: select the number of rows. If 0, the script will guess it using the number of columns.<br>
<b>columns</b>: select the number of columns. If 0, the script will guess it using the number of rows (it might change the number of rows to respect the horizontal priority)<br>
If both rows and columns are set to 0, the default value will be used for both <i>(I'm torn between the default being one row or a square-ish image, I'd love to hear what other people think about this)</i><br>
<b>start</b> and <b>end</b>: the start and end of the animation to export to spritesheet. Anything outside those values will not be considered.<br>
<b>step</b>: Only consider every 'step' frame when exporting to spritesheet<br>
If start and end are both set to 0, it will use the default value for both (that is, the actual animation length, considering all visible layers)<br>
<b>remove individual sprites</b>: whether to remove the folder containing the individual exported sprites once finished. You'll usually want this on, but you do you.<br>
<b>force new folder</b>: if the export folder already exists, whether to create a new one in its parent directory (checked), or export in it anyway, potentially overwriting existing files (unchecked).
</p>

<br>
<h3>Other spritesheet manipulations</h3>
<p>
If you want to <b>import spritesheets</b>, just use the built-in tools and simply (with your spritesheet open) go to Image > Image Split then (in a new file of the same dimensions as one frame), File > Import Animation Frames (<a href ="https://docs.krita.org/en/user_manual/animation.html#importing-animation-frames">official tuto with images here</a>)<br>
If you want to <b>merge existing spritesheets</b>, open the biggest one to get a document its size, then remove or hide it so your document is empty, then import each spritesheet on a different frame (File > Import Animation Frames) and export them as a spritesheet (Tools > Scripts > Export As Spritesheet); you probably want 1 column and 0 (default) rows if your individual spritesheets are each one line<br>
</p>


<br>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><b>Warning</b>: Don't switch active window while the script is exporting, or it will get interrupted and, most likely, not create the final spritesheet and leave rogue sprite exports (and maybe a sprite export folder, depending on your settings) in your export folder. If this happens, just close the plugin window, remove the unneeded files and try exporting again.</p>
